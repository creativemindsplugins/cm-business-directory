**Our WordPress Business Directory plugin is a powerful tool that simplifies the creation of an extensive business directory on your WordPress site.**

With it, you can categorize and compile a detailed listing of businesses with ease. This plugin is designed to help you build a robust directory that rivals the functionality of major platforms like Yelp, Yahoo, or Yellow Pages, providing users with a user-friendly interface to search for businesses by category. Whether you’re aiming to create a local resource or a comprehensive business hub, our plugin offers the flexibility and features needed to create a professional-looking directory effortlessly.

## Installation and Usage

* Move the plugin folder into the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory on your site.
* Turn on the plugin by selecting it from the ‘Plugins’ section in your WordPress dashboard.
* Set up your directory preferences, like the number of businesses to display on the main page.
* Begin by crafting the page for your initial business listing.

Remember: your theme must include a wp_head() function call for the plugin’s JavaScript and CSS to function correctly. If your theme lacks this feature, you’ll need to incorporate these files into your theme manually, which is not the preferred method.

## Directory Listing Plugin Index Page

The directory’s main page offers a detailed roster of businesses, enhanced with search and extra sorting features. Administrators have complete command over the index page’s look and capabilities, guaranteeing a fluid experience for visitors.

## Directory Listing Plugin Business Page

Every business established through the plugin receives a dedicated page that can showcase the business’s name, emblem, photos, videos, narrative, contact details, hyperlinks, and other bespoke content.
